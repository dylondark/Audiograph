# Audiograph 

Audiograph is a music tracking application that uses the [Last.fm](https://www.last.fm) service to display data on your listening habits and on music in general. It can be thought of as a GUI for Last.fm, although it adds some extra features.
Features include:
- Displays top music charts worldwide/by country
- Ability to search for and display information on specific tracks/artists/albums/genres
- User sign-in system: will display information about your user account such as play history, top charts, liked songs, etc
- User lookup: Can also display the same information about other users
- A scrobbler that can either be used manually or automatically via media player and scrobble indexes
- A backup tool that can back up nearly any information from Last.fm to a local file
- A developer console that has some neat functions
- And more!
